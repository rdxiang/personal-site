        <b>Addiction</b>
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Video games may not be drugs, but they can be addicting. This serious problem has been
        given new light by a national Harris Poll survey. The survey found that nearly one in 10 gamers are pathological
        players, which is defined as causing social or psychological damage. These effects are clearly dehabilitating,
        especially given that 4% of gamers are extreme users and average 50 hours per week. Video games are fun, be must
        be wary to play in moderation.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Violence Exposure</b>
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; It's clear that violence in video games is more prevalent in real life and many gamers
        act out violent scenes that they would never consider doing in real life. According to the New York Times, a
        study by the University of Texas showed that gamers who played Mortal Kombat for 15 minutes were more aggressive
        afterwards in a social situation compared to gamers who played a nonviolent video game. It is also known that
        the young men who opened fire at Columbine High School and other similar tragedies seemed to be acting out
        violent games. Whehter or not there is a direct connection between real violence and video games is uncertain,
        but it is certain that video games raise exposure levels to violence.

        <b>Social Consequences</b>
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; According to the New York Times, a recent study in the journal of pediatrics found that
        children who spent more time playing video games were more impulsive and less comfortable than other children.
        Another study found that in 1,000 healthy CHinese teenagers, those who used the gamed excessively were twice as
        likely to be depressed nine months later. While games are fun, real life is better.
