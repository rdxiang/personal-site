        <b>Educational Uses</b>
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Video games have successfully brought into classrooms and used to give students an
        interactive platform for learning that captures their attention. For example, according to Scientific American
        magazine, a game called River City has been used to instruct students in grades six through nine about
        epidemiology. Students can learn about the impact and spread of diseases and human interactions. Games likes
        these can help enrich the learning envirnoment and give kids a creative way to stay engaged.

        <b>Physical Benefits</b>
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; While video games are often associated with couch potatoes, a new wave of video games
        has been changing the game. USA Today reported that a study at Deakin University showed that gamers score faster
        reaction times in real life, have better hand-eye coordination, and manual dexterity, even in preschoolers. On
        another level of physical benefits, video games have been used to rehabilitate stroke victims. According to
        Engadget, Limbs Alive, a game publisher, has created Circus Challenge which helps patients recover their motor
        skills and rebuild strength. It seems like video games have some health benefits after all!

        <b>Mental Benefits</b>
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Despite the recreational appearance of video games, it has been shown that video games
        actually contribute to mental capacities. A study done by the University fo Gothenburg in Sweden proved that,
        even in violent games, players learn how to control their aggression and work cooperatively. In addition,
        Michigan State University, has completed a study that demonsrates that kids who play video games score up to 23%
        higher in creative tests.
